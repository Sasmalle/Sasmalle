# üë§ About Me

Hello everyone! üëã I'm Alessandro, and this is my personal GitHub repository where I share my projects and code. Let me introduce myself!

## üìö Background

I have a higher education background in electronics and electrical engineering, having studied at a technical institute. During my time there, I built a strong foundation in programming and learned languages such as C, Sketch, Wiring (Arduino), and Python. Subsequently, I pursued my passion for technology by enrolling in the Bachelor's degree program in Computer Science at the University of Turin.

While studying, I ventured into the working world, starting at a company specializing in ERP systems and databases. During this experience, I learned and utilized the RPG language and the IBMi (AS400) operating system. After completing this work experience, I undertook a specialized 4-month programming course, expanding my skills to include Java, Spring, JavaScript, Git, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Angular.

Following this course, I took the next step, becoming a Full Stack Developer Junior at a consulting company. This experience marks a significant milestone in my journey, where I continue to apply my diverse skill set in programming, Full Stack development, and my passion for technology and creativity. During my time at this company, I refined my knowledge of Java on the server-side (Spring & SpringBoot) and Angular. I also expanded my technical expertise by learning Node.js and React.

## üíº Projects and Career Growth

During my time in high school, I worked on numerous projects that allowed me to apply my skills in programming and electronics, ranging from small-scale automation systems to interactive electronic installations. Each project taught me valuable lessons about problem-solving, teamwork, and creative thinking.

Moreover, as a Full Stack Developer Junior, I had the opportunity to further expand my skills. I created several significant projects, including a management system for company cost control.

Additionally, I take pride in contributing to an innovative startup called YOLO. Our vision is to revolutionize the concept of a traditional company by leveraging technology and innovative strategies. Through YOLO, we aim to reshape the way businesses operate, promoting a culture of agility, adaptability, and continuous innovation. It's an exhilarating journey that challenges me to think outside the box and pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the business world.
