# About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alessandro, and this is my personal GitHub repository where I share my projects and code. Let me introduce myself!

## Background
I have a background in **electronics and electrical engineering**, having studied at a technical high school. During my time there, I gained a solid foundation in programming and learned languages like **C** and **Sketch**. Later, I pursued my passion for technology by enrolling in the **Computer Science program** at university.

While studying, I ventured into the world of programming and began working with **ERP systems and databases**. I primarily utilized the **RPG language** and the **IBMi (AS400) operating system**. Through this experience, I gained practical knowledge in developing systems and handling databases.

Following an internship, I joined a company where I honed my skills as a **Full Stack developer**. I completed a specialized 4-month course where I studied a wide range of modern programming languages, markup languages, and frameworks, including **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Git**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Angular**.

On a personal level, I have also dabbled in **Python**. Additionally, I have acquired proficiency in using various graphic software tools from Adobe's suite, such as **Photoshop**, **Lightroom**, **Illustrator**, **Premiere**, and **After Effects**.


## Interests and Expertise
I am a passionate individual who loves **music, technology, and art**. I constantly seek new ways to combine these three elements and explore their intersections.

Music has always been a significant part of my life, and I find inspiration in various genres and styles. Whether it's playing an instrument, producing music digitally, or simply enjoying a captivating melody, I find solace and creativity in the world of sound.

My enthusiasm for technology drives me to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements. I'm fascinated by emerging technologies such as **artificial intelligence**, **blockchain**, and **virtual reality**. I believe in leveraging technology to create innovative solutions and enhance user experiences.

Art, in all its forms, captivates me. From visual arts to multimedia installations, I appreciate the power of creative expression. I enjoy exploring the possibilities of combining technology and art to create immersive experiences or thought-provoking projects.

By merging my passions for music, technology, and art, I strive to create unique projects that push boundaries and inspire others. I'm always open to collaboration and eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share similar interests.


## Projects
During my time in high school, I worked on numerous projects that allowed me to apply my programming and electronics skills. These projects ranged from small-scale automation systems to interactive electronic installations. Each project taught me valuable lessons about problem-solving, teamwork, and creative thinking.

Currently, I am excited to be working on a groundbreaking startup called **YOLO**. Our vision is to revolutionize the concept of a traditional company by leveraging technology and innovative strategies. Through YOLO, we aim to reshape the way businesses operate, promoting a culture of agility, adaptability, and continuous innovation. It's an exciting journey that challenges me to think outside the box and pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the business world.

I'm proud to be part of this ambitious venture and contribute my skills in programming, Full Stack development, and my passion for technology and creativity to help shape the future of YOLO.

Stay tuned for updates on the progress of YOLO and the exciting projects we are working on!
